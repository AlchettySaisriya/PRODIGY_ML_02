# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project performs customer segmentation using **K-Means clustering** on a mall customer dataset. The goal is to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics based on age, income, and spending behavior.

---

## **Features Used**

- **Age** – Customer age  
- **Annual Income (k$)** – Customer's yearly income in thousands  
- **Spending Score (1-100)** – Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior  

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – for visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – for clustering and evaluation metrics  

---

## **What This Project Does**

- Loads and cleans the mall customer dataset  
- Encodes categorical features and handles missing values  
- Scales numerical data for clustering  
- Applies the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine optimal clusters  
- Fits a **K-Means clustering model**  
- Visualizes the resulting customer segments using scatter plots  

---

## **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository  
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Open `ML_Task2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook  
4. Run all cells to view clustering results and visualizations

## **Possible Improvements**

- Apply other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering  
- Use additional features for more complex segmentation  
- Deploy the clustering interface via a web app
